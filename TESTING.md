# Distributed Monitoring System - Testing Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the distributed monitoring system, including unit tests, integration tests, and frontend tests.

## Test Structure

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests

```bash
# Run all backend tests
cd backend
bun test

# Run specific test files
bun test src/tests/distributed-monitoring.test.ts
bun test src/tests/integration.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
bun test --coverage
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies (when available)
cd frontend
bun add -d vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

# Run frontend tests (when test runner is configured)
bun test
```

## Test Scenarios Covered

### 1. Instance Registration Flow
```
Primary Instance ← Register ← Dependent Instance
     ↓
  Store Instance Data
     ↓
  Generate Auth Token
     ↓
  Return Success Response
```

### 2. Heartbeat Processing Flow
```
Dependent Instance → Heartbeat + Results → Primary Instance
                                               ↓
                                        Process Results
                                               ↓
                                        Update Instance Status
                                               ↓
                                        Store Monitoring Data
                                               ↓
                                        Calculate Consensus
```

### 3. Multi-Location Consensus
```
Location A: UP (120ms)     ←→
Location B: UP (180ms)     ←→  Consensus Engine  → PARTIAL Status
Location C: DOWN (0ms)     ←→
```

### 4. Failover Ordering
```
Primary (Order 0): FAILED
     ↓
Backup 1 (Order 1): ACTIVE → Promote to Primary
     ↓
Backup 2 (Order 2): STANDBY
```

## Performance Benchmarks

- Coverage trend analysis
- Performance regression detection

## Troubleshooting Tests

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure SQLite is available and permissions are correct
2. **Timing Issues**: Use proper async/await patterns and timeouts
3. **Mock Service Failures**: Verify mock configurations match actual APIs
4. **Authentication Errors**: Check JWT token generation and validation logic

### Debugging Tips
- Use detailed logging in test environments
- Enable SQL query logging for database issues
- Check network connectivity for integration tests
- Verify mock service configurations

This comprehensive testing strategy ensures the distributed monitoring system is reliable, performant, and secure across all deployment scenarios.
