# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

The endpoint monitoring application has been successfully enhanced with comprehensive distributed monitoring capabilities. The primary/dependent instance architecture with automatic failover is fully implemented and operational. The system provides robust multi-location monitoring with consensus status determination, high availability features, and enterprise-grade reliability. All distributed monitoring components are production-ready and actively maintained.

## Recent State

### Completed Implementation
- **Core Monitoring**: All four monitoring types (HTTP, TCP, Ping, Kafka) are fully functional
- **Distributed Monitoring**: Primary/dependent instance architecture with automatic failover
- **Authentication System**: Complete JWT-based auth with OIDC integration support
- **Frontend Interface**: React-based dashboard with MUI components and real-time updates
- **Database Layer**: SQLite with comprehensive schema supporting all features including distributed monitoring
- **Notification System**: Multi-channel notifications (Telegram, SendGrid, Slack, Apprise)
- **Analytics**: Gap-aware uptime calculations and advanced response time statistics
- **Certificate Monitoring**: SSL certificate expiration tracking with alerts
- **Public Status Pages**: Configurable public-facing status displays
- **Build System**: Custom Bun-based build pipeline for both frontend and backend
- **Multi-Location Monitoring**: Geographic monitoring with consensus status determination
- **High Availability**: Automatic failover and instance health monitoring

### Current Architecture State
- **Backend**: ElysiaJS framework with TypeScript, structured in services/routes pattern
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, MUI for UI components, client-side routing
- **Database**: SQLite with 15+ tables covering all application features including distributed monitoring
- **Runtime**: Bun for both frontend and backend operations
- **Deployment**: Docker-first approach with production and development configurations
- **Distributed Architecture**: Primary/dependent instance model with automatic failover

### Key Features Ready
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- Multi-protocol monitoring with configurable intervals
- Real-time heartbeat visualization
- Comprehensive uptime statistics with gap awareness
- mTLS support for HTTP and Kafka endpoints
- Domain information monitoring via RDAP
- User preference storage and synchronization
- Endpoint grouping and organization
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Distributed monitoring with primary/dependent instances
- Automatic failover and high availability
- Multi-location monitoring with consensus status
- Instance health monitoring and management

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
- Performance optimization for large-scale distributed deployments
- Enhanced multi-location monitoring visualizations
- Extended notification channel integrations
- Advanced alerting rules and escalation policies
- Distributed monitoring documentation and deployment guides
- Production deployment and monitoring of distributed instances

### Future Enhancements
- Mobile application development
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external monitoring platforms
- Enhanced security features and audit logging

## Development Environment

The project uses a modern development stack optimized for TypeScript development:
- Bun as the primary runtime and package manager
- Hot reloading for development workflows
- Comprehensive validation and security measures
- Docker-based deployment with health checks
- Automated database migrations and setup

## Project Maturity

This is a production-ready monitoring application with enterprise-grade features including security, scalability, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities. The codebase demonstrates mature software engineering practices with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and security-first design principles.
